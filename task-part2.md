# CollabCanvas AI Agent - Part 2 Development Tasks

## Overview
Build an AI Canvas Agent that manipulates the collaborative canvas through natural language using OpenAI GPT-4 function calling. Users can say "Create a blue rectangle in the center" and the AI executes canvas operations that sync in real-time to all users.

**Prerequisites**: Part 1 must be complete (multiplayer canvas with real-time sync, object locking, cursor tracking)

## Technical Architecture

### AI Service Stack
```typescript
// Core AI service structure
interface AIService {
  processCommand(message: string, canvasContext: CanvasContext): Promise<AIResponse>
  executeOperations(operations: CanvasOperation[]): Promise<ExecutionResult>
  getCanvasContext(): CanvasContext
}

// Function calling schema
interface CanvasTool {
  name: string
  description: string
  parameters: ToolParameters
  handler: (params: any) => Promise<CanvasOperation>
}
```

### Integration Points
- **Canvas Service**: Extend existing operations for AI use
- **Real-time Sync**: All AI operations sync via existing Firestore system  
- **User Interface**: Integrate chat panel with existing layout
- **Error Handling**: Extend existing toast system for AI feedback

### Performance Targets
- **Latency**: <2s for single-step commands
- **Throughput**: Handle 10+ concurrent AI requests  
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ command interpretation success
- **Reliability**: <1% operation failures
- **User Experience**: Immediate visual feedback, smooth interactions

### Security Considerations
- Input sanitization for all AI-generated parameters
