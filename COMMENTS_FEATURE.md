## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### File Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ comments.ts                  # TypeScript interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ commentService.ts            # Firestore operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ useComments.ts               # React hooks for comments
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CommentPanel.tsx             # Main sidebar component
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CommentThread.tsx            # Individual comment display
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CommentInput.tsx             # Comment input form
```

### Data Model

**Firestore Collection:** `/canvas/global/comments/{commentId}`

```typescript
interface Comment {
  id: string;
  objectId: string;              // Canvas object this comment is attached to
  content: string;               // Comment text
  createdBy: string;             // User ID
  createdByName: string;         // User display name
  createdByColor: string;        // User's cursor color (for avatar)
  createdAt: number;             // Timestamp
  modifiedAt?: number;           // Last edit timestamp
  resolved: boolean;             // Resolution state
  resolvedBy?: string;           // Who resolved it
  resolvedAt?: number;           // When resolved
  mentions?: string[];           // Array of mentioned usernames
}
```

### Real-Time Synchronization

**How it works:**
1. User adds a comment ‚Üí Immediately appears locally (optimistic update)
2. Comment saved to Firestore ‚Üí Broadcasts to all clients
3. Other users' panels update instantly via `onSnapshot` listener
4. All operations (create, resolve, delete) sync in real-time

**Performance:**
- Uses Firestore subcollection for scalability
- React.memo on all comment components
- Efficient re-rendering (only changed comments update)
- Throttled updates where needed

## üîß API Reference

### React Hooks

#### `useComments(userId, userName, userColor)`

Manages all comments with real-time sync.

**Returns:**
```typescript
{
  comments: Comment[];              // All comments
  commentThreads: CommentThread[];  // Grouped by object
  loading: boolean;                 // Loading state
  addComment: (data) => Promise<void>;
  editComment: (id, content) => Promise<void>;
  removeComment: (id) => Promise<void>;
  toggleResolved: (id, resolved) => Promise<void>;
  getCommentsForObject: (objectId) => Comment[];
  getUnresolvedCount: (objectId) => number;
}
```

#### `useObjectComments(objectId, userId, userName, userColor)`

Manages comments for a specific object.

**Returns:**
```typescript
{
  comments: Comment[];              // Comments for this object
  unresolvedCount: number;          // Number unresolved
  loading: boolean;
  addComment: (content) => Promise<void>;
  toggleResolved: (id, resolved) => Promise<void>;
  removeComment: (id) => Promise<void>;
}
```

### Service Functions

#### `commentService.ts`

```typescript
// Create a comment
createComment(data, userId, userName, userColor): Promise<string>

// Update a comment
updateComment(commentId, updates): Promise<void>

// Delete a comment
deleteComment(commentId): Promise<void>

// Resolve/unresolve
resolveComment(commentId, userId): Promise<void>
unresolveComment(commentId): Promise<void>

// Real-time subscriptions
subscribeToComments(callback): () => void
subscribeToObjectComments(objectId, callback): () => void

// Utilities
parseMentions(text): string[]
deleteObjectComments(objectId): Promise<void>
```

---

## üîê Security & Permissions

### Firestore Rules

```javascript
// Comments subcollection under canvas/global
match /canvas/global/comments/{commentId} {
  allow read, write: if true;  // Open for MVP
}
```

**Note:** Currently open for development. For production, consider:
- Only authenticated users can create comments
- Only comment author can delete their own comments
- Anyone can resolve/unresolve (or restrict to object owner)

### Recommended Production Rules

```javascript
match /canvas/global/comments/{commentId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow create: if request.auth != null 
    && request.resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid;
  allow update: if request.auth != null;
  allow delete: if request.auth != null 
    && resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid;
}
```

## üöÄ Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Component Memoization**
   - `CommentPanel` and `CommentThread` use `React.memo`
   - Only re-render when comment data changes

2. **Efficient Queries**
   - Comments indexed by `objectId` for fast filtering
   - Firestore queries sorted by `createdAt` (server-side)

3. **Optimistic Updates**
   - UI updates immediately before Firestore confirms
   - Provides instant feedback

4. **Lazy Loading** (Future)
   - Paginate comments for objects with 100+ comments
   - Virtual scrolling for long comment lists

### Expected Performance

- **10-50 comments:** Instant, no perceptible lag
- **50-200 comments:** Smooth, minimal delay
- **200+ comments:** Consider pagination
