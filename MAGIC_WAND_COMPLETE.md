## 🎓 Tips & Tricks

### Finding the Right Tolerance

**Start with 15 (default)**
- Good for selecting "the same color"
- Handles minor variations in hex values

**Use 0 for exact matches**
- When you need pixel-perfect color matching
- Good for programmatically generated colors

**Use 30-50 for color families**
- Select all reds, all blues, etc.
- Useful for organizing by color theme

**Use 80-100 for very loose matching**
- Experimental - might select unexpected objects
- Good for "anything similar to this"
