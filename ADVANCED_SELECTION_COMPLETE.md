## 🚀 What Was Built

Two powerful selection tools from **Phase 17** of your roadmap:

### 1. **Select Inverse** (Ctrl+Shift+I) 🔄
Select everything EXCEPT what's currently selected.

**Use cases:**
- Want to delete everything except your logo? Select logo → Ctrl+Shift+I → Delete
- Working with a specific group? Select them → Invert → Work on everything else
- Quick way to flip selection without manual clicking

### 2. **Select by Type** 🎯
Select all objects of a specific type with one click.

**Options:**
- ◻️ Select All Rectangles
- ⚪ Select All Circles
- 🔤 Select All Text

**Use cases:**
- Style all text objects at once
- Move all circles to one area
- Delete all rectangles quickly
- Organize canvas by shape type
