# Selection Filters Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented Phase 17.4: Selection Filters - an advanced filtering UI that allows users to filter and select objects based on multiple criteria with live preview highlighting.

## Implementation Date
October 17, 2025

## Components Created

### 1. SelectionFilterPanel Component (`src/components/SelectionFilterPanel.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Modal UI for filtering objects by multiple criteria
- **Features**:
  - Filter by object type (rectangle, circle, text)
  - Filter by color (multi-select with color swatches)
  - Filter by size range (min/max width and height)
  - Filter by creator (objects I created / objects created by others)
  - Live preview toggle (highlight matching objects on canvas)
  - Clear filters button
  - Real-time match count display
  - Apply button to finalize selection

- **Key Props**:
  - `isOpen`: Controls modal visibility
  - `onClose`: Callback when modal closes
  - `objects`: Array of all canvas objects
  - `currentUserId`: ID of current user (for creator filtering)
  - `onPreview`: Callback to update preview highlights (passes matching IDs)
  - `onApply`: Callback to apply selection (passes matching IDs)

- **UI Elements**:
  - Type filter: Toggle buttons for rectangle, circle, text
  - Color filter: Color swatches from available colors in canvas
  - Size filter: Number inputs for min/max width and height with placeholders showing actual range
  - Creator filter: Checkboxes for "my objects" vs "others' objects"
  - Live preview checkbox
  - Match count indicator
  - Clear filters and apply buttons

### 2. Filter Types (`src/types/filters.ts`)
- **FilterCriteria**: Interface defining all filter options
  - `types`: Array of object types to include
  - `colors`: Array of colors to match
  - `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `minHeight`, `maxHeight`: Size constraints
  - `createdByMe`, `createdByOthers`: Creator filters
  - `specificCreators`: Filter by specific user IDs (for future use)

- **FilterPreset**: Interface for saving filter presets (prepared for future feature)
- **FilterState**: Interface for managing filter UI state

### 3. Filter Utilities (`src/utils/filterUtils.ts`)
- **applyFilters**: Main filtering function that applies criteria to object array
  - Type filtering
  - Color matching (case-insensitive)
  - Size range validation using `getShapeDimensions`
  - Creator filtering by user ID
  
- **hasActiveFilters**: Check if any filters are currently applied
- **clearFilters**: Reset all filter criteria
- **getUniqueColorsFromObjects**: Extract unique colors from canvas objects
- **getUniqueCreators**: Extract unique creator IDs
- **getSizeRange**: Calculate min/max dimensions from all objects

## Canvas Integration

### Live Preview Highlighting

#### Canvas Props Enhancement
- Added `filterPreviewIds` prop to `Canvas` component
- Passed down to shape rendering as `isFilterPreview` prop

#### Shape Component Updates

**Rectangle Component** (`src/components/Rectangle.tsx`):
- Added `isFilterPreview` prop
- Renders blue semi-transparent overlay with dashed border when in preview mode
- Preview style: `rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.15)` fill, `#3B82F6` stroke, `[6, 3]` dash

**Circle Component** (`src/components/Circle.tsx`):
- Added `isFilterPreview` prop
- Renders preview overlay as a larger circle (radius + 2px)
- Same blue styling as rectangle

**TextObject Component** (`src/components/TextObject.tsx`):
- Added `isFilterPreview` prop
- Renders preview overlay as a rectangle around text bounds
- Consistent styling across all shape types

### Selection Application

#### Canvas Methods
- **selectByIds**: New method exposed via `CanvasRef`
  - Accepts array of object IDs to select
  - Releases current locks
  - Acquires locks on specified objects
  - Shows toast feedback for lock status
  - Used by filter panel to apply final selection

## App.tsx Integration

### State Management
- `showFilterPanel`: Boolean state for modal visibility
- `filterPreviewIds`: Array of IDs currently being previewed

### UI Integration
- Added "üéõÔ∏è Advanced Filters" button to Select dropdown menu
- Opens SelectionFilterPanel modal
- Clears preview IDs when modal closes

### Filter Panel Callbacks
- **onPreview**: Updates `filterPreviewIds` state for live highlighting
- **onApply**: Calls `canvasRef.current?.selectByIds()` to finalize selection
  - Clears preview
  - Acquires locks and selects objects
  - Closes modal

## User Experience Features

### Live Preview
- Toggle checkbox to enable/disable preview mode
- When enabled, matching objects are highlighted in real-time as filters change
- Preview uses non-intrusive blue overlay with dashed border
- Distinct from selection (solid border) and locks (colored borders)
- Preview is automatically cleared when modal closes

### Feedback
- Real-time match count: "X of Y objects match"
- Preview toggle for users who prefer to see results only when applied
- Toast notifications when selection is applied (success/warning for locked objects)
- Visual distinction between filter preview and actual selection

### Filter Combinations
- All filters work together (AND logic)
- Can combine type + color + size + creator filters
- Clear button to reset all filters at once
- Disabled apply button when no matches found

### Accessibility
- Modal with backdrop overlay
- Click outside or close button to dismiss
- Keyboard-friendly form inputs
- Clear visual feedback for active filters
- Labeled inputs with placeholders showing actual data ranges

## Technical Implementation Details

### Performance Considerations
- Filter calculations performed on every criteria change (fast due to simple array operations)
- Preview updates throttled by React's rendering cycle
- Lock acquisition only happens on apply, not during preview
- No network requests during filtering (all client-side)

### Lock Management
- Preview mode does not acquire locks (read-only)
- Apply button releases current selection locks before acquiring new ones
- Handles locked objects gracefully (shows count of locked objects in toast)

### Multi-User Safety
- Filter results reflect current canvas state
- Lock status checked when applying selection
- Users notified if some objects are locked by others

## Documentation Updates

### ShortcutsPanel.tsx
- Added "üéõÔ∏è Select Menu" to selection tools section
- Describes access to advanced filters panel

### README.md
- Added "Selection Filters" to Core Canvas Features
- Updated keyboard shortcuts section with Select Menu reference
- Documented live preview and filter capabilities

## Testing Recommendations

### Basic Functionality
1. Open filter panel from Select menu
2. Test each filter type individually:
   - Type filter: Select rectangles only, circles only, text only
   - Color filter: Select objects by color (single and multiple)
   - Size filter: Filter by width/height ranges
   - Creator filter: Filter by "my objects" vs "others' objects"
3. Test filter combinations (multiple filters active)
4. Test clear filters button
5. Test live preview toggle

### Edge Cases
1. Empty canvas (no objects)
2. No matches for filter criteria
3. All objects match filter
4. Some matched objects are locked by others
5. Filter panel open while objects are added/removed
6. Multiple users with filter panel open simultaneously

### Performance Testing
1. Large canvas with 100+ objects
2. Rapid filter changes
3. Complex filter combinations
4. Live preview with many matches

### Multi-User Testing
1. User A filters and selects objects
2. User B tries to select same objects
3. Lock conflict handling
4. Preview doesn't interfere with other users

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Filter Presets (Prepared Interface)
- Save frequently used filter combinations
- Load saved presets
- Share presets between users
- Interface already defined in `filters.ts`

### Additional Filters
- Filter by z-index/layer position
- Filter by rotation angle
- Filter by object name/label (if added)
- Filter by last modified date
- Filter by object properties (stroke width, opacity, etc.)

### Advanced Features
- OR logic option (match any filter vs all filters)
- Exclude mode (inverse of current filters)
- Regular expression matching for text content
- Save filter results as groups
- Bulk operations on filtered results

### UI Improvements
- Color picker for custom color filtering
- Slider for size ranges (instead of number inputs)
- Visual size preview (small/medium/large buttons)
- Filter history (recently used filters)
- Drag-to-reorder filter priority

## Architecture Notes

### Separation of Concerns
- Filter logic isolated in `filterUtils.ts`
- UI logic in `SelectionFilterPanel.tsx`
- Canvas rendering updates in shape components
- State management in `App.tsx`
- Clean interfaces for extensibility

### Type Safety
- All filter criteria strongly typed
- Shape-specific filtering uses existing utilities
- Canvas integration through well-defined interfaces

### Reusability
- Filter utilities can be used elsewhere (e.g., bulk operations, AI commands)
- Preview highlighting system can be extended for other features
- Modal pattern can be reused for other panels

## Known Limitations

1. No persistent filter presets (state lost on refresh)
2. No filter history
3. Color matching is exact (no color similarity/tolerance like magic wand)
4. Size filters are manual input only (no slider UI)
5. Cannot filter by text content (only by object type)
6. Creator filter limited to "me" vs "others" (no specific user selection)

## Integration Points

### With Existing Features
- **Locking System**: Respects object locks when applying selection
- **Multi-Select**: Results can be added to existing selection with Shift
- **Toast System**: Provides feedback for selection results
- **Canvas Objects**: Uses existing object structure and utilities

### With Future Features
- Filter presets can be stored in Firebase
- AI can use filter utilities for smart selections
- Export system could use filters for batch export
- Groups could be filtered by membership

## Code Quality

### Standards Met
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- React best practices (hooks, memoization)
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive type definitions
- Consistent naming conventions
- No linter errors
- Successful build
