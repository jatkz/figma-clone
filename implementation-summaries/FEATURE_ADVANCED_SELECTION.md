# Advanced Selection Tools - Implementation Summary

**Feature**: Select Inverse & Select by Type  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Phase**: 17.2 & 17.3 (from task-part3.md)

---

## Overview

Implemented two powerful selection tools from Phase 17 of the roadmap:
1. **Select Inverse** - Select all objects except currently selected ones
2. **Select by Type** - Select all objects of a specific type (rectangles, circles, or text)

These features provide quick, efficient ways to manage complex selections on the canvas.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Select Inverse (Ctrl+Shift+I)
- **Inverts current selection** - Selects everything that's NOT selected
- **Smart lock handling** - Tries to acquire locks on all unselected objects
- **Partial success feedback** - Shows "Selected X of Y. Z locked by others"
- **Empty selection handling** - Shows helpful message if no objects available
- **Keyboard shortcut** - Ctrl+Shift+I for quick access

### 2. Select by Type
- **Select all rectangles** - One click selects all rectangle objects
- **Select all circles** - One click selects all circle objects  
- **Select all text** - One click selects all text objects
- **Add to selection mode** - Optional parameter to add instead of replace
- **Accessible via menu** - Dropdown menu in header toolbar
- **Smart feedback** - Shows count and locked object information

## Technical Implementation

### Select Inverse Algorithm
```typescript
const handleSelectInverse = async () => {
  // 1. Get all object IDs on canvas
  const allIds = objects.map(obj => obj.id);
  
  // 2. Filter out currently selected objects
  const unselectedIds = allIds.filter(id => !selectedObjectIds.includes(id));
  
  // 3. Release current locks
  await releaseMultipleLocks(selectedObjectIds);
  
  // 4. Try to acquire locks on unselected objects
  const lockedIds = await acquireMultipleLocks(unselectedIds);
  
  // 5. Update selection state
  setSelectedObjectIds(lockedIds);
  
  // 6. Show feedback (with partial success handling)
};
```

### Select by Type Algorithm
```typescript
const handleSelectByType = async (objectType, addToSelection = false) => {
  // 1. Filter objects by type
  const matchingObjects = objects.filter(obj => obj.type === objectType);
  
  // 2. Determine new selection (replace or add)
  let newSelection;
  if (addToSelection) {
    newSelection = [...selectedObjectIds, ...matchingIds]; // Merge
  } else {
    await releaseMultipleLocks(selectedObjectIds);
    newSelection = matchingIds; // Replace
  }
  
  // 3. Acquire locks on new selection
  const lockedIds = await acquireMultipleLocks(newSelection);
  
  // 4. Update selection and show feedback
  setSelectedObjectIds(lockedIds);
};
```

## User Interface

### Select Menu Dropdown
A new dropdown menu in the header provides quick access:

```
🎯 Select
  ├─ ◻️ Select All Rectangles
  ├─ ⚪ Select All Circles  
  ├─ 🔤 Select All Text
  ├─ ─────────────────────
  └─ 🔄 Select Inverse (Ctrl+Shift+I)
```

### Visual Feedback
- **Success**: "Selected 8 rectangles" (green toast)
- **Partial**: "Selected 5 of 8 circles. 3 locked by others" (yellow toast)
- **Empty**: "No rectangles found" (info toast)

---

## Use Cases

### Select Inverse
**Scenario**: User wants to delete everything EXCEPT a logo
1. Select the logo object
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+I (or use Select menu)
3. All other objects are selected
4. Press Delete to remove them

**Scenario**: Working with a subset of objects
1. Select a few objects you want to keep
2. Invert selection
3. Apply operations to everything else

### Select by Type
**Scenario**: Quickly style all text objects
1. Click "Select All Text" from menu
2. All text objects are selected
3. Apply formatting changes

**Scenario**: Organize canvas by shape type
1. Select all circles
2. Move them to one area
3. Select all rectangles
4. Move them to another area

---

## Multi-User Collaboration

Both features properly handle multi-user scenarios:

### Lock Acquisition
- Attempts to lock all target objects
- Allows partial success (some objects locked by others)
- Shows clear feedback about what was/wasn't selected

### Example Multi-User Flow
```
User A: Editing 3 rectangles (locked)
User B: Clicks "Select All Rectangles" (8 total)
Result: User B selects 5 rectangles (excluding User A's 3)
Feedback: "Selected 5 of 8 rectangles. 3 locked by others"
```

---

## Performance

### Select Inverse
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n = total objects
- **Operations**: Single filter pass, lock acquisition
- **Performance**: Instant for <1000 objects

### Select by Type  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n = total objects
- **Operations**: Single filter pass by type, lock acquisition
- **Performance**: Instant for <1000 objects

Both operations are highly efficient and don't require any visual rendering updates until completion.

## Testing

### ✅ Manual Testing Completed
- [x] Select inverse with no objects selected → Selects all
- [x] Select inverse with one object selected → Selects rest
- [x] Select inverse with all selected → Shows "No objects to select"
- [x] Select all rectangles → Selects only rectangles
- [x] Select all circles → Selects only circles  
- [x] Select all text → Selects only text
- [x] Select by type with no objects of that type → Shows helpful message
- [x] Keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+I works
- [x] Dropdown menu shows/hides correctly
- [x] Multi-user lock conflicts handled gracefully
- [x] Toast notifications show correct counts

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ Empty canvas (no objects)
- ✅ No objects of selected type
- ✅ All objects locked by other users
- ✅ Mixed selection scenarios
- ✅ Rapid successive selections
