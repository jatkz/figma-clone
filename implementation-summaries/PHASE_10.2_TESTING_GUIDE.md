## Quick Smoke Test (5 minutes)

If time is limited, run these essential tests:

1. **Test 1**: `Create a hero section` - Verify basic pattern
2. **Test 5**: `Create a sidebar menu` - Verify different layout
3. **Test 9**: `Create a modal dialog` - Verify complex pattern
4. **Test 11**: `Create a landing page with hero section and feature grid` - Verify combination
5. **Test 16**: `Create a login form` - Verify regression

If all 5 pass, Phase 10.2 is likely working correctly.

## Success Metrics

**Full Success**: 24/26 tests pass (93%+)  
**Acceptable**: 21/26 tests pass (81%+)  
**Needs Work**: <21 tests pass

## Additional Notes

### Debugging Tips
- Check browser console for AI function calls
- Look for `🤖 AI requested N function calls` logs
- Verify each `createShape` and `arrangeShapes` call
- Check for error toasts on canvas

### Common Issues
- **Pattern not created**: Check if GPT-4 is calling the right tools
- **Wrong arrangement**: Verify `arrangeShapes` parameters
- **Missing elements**: Check if all `createShape` calls succeeded
- **Overlapping elements**: Spacing or positioning issue in arrangement

### When Tests Fail
1. Note the specific command that failed
2. Check console logs for errors
3. Verify system prompt has correct pattern examples
4. Test with simpler variation of the command
5. Check if it's a tool execution issue vs pattern understanding issue
