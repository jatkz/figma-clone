## Expected Behaviors

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators

1. **All Elements Created**
   - Check console logs for createShape calls
   - Verify each expected element appears

2. **Proper Arrangement**
   - Forms: Vertical alignment
   - Navbars: Horizontal alignment
   - Consistent spacing

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - See "Executing operation X of Y" messages
   - Progress indicator shows current operation

4. **Design Standards Applied**
   - Input backgrounds: Light gray
   - Buttons: Blue with white text
   - Appropriate sizes (~300x40 inputs, 200x50 buttons)

5. **Feedback Messages**
   - "‚úÖ All X operations completed successfully"
   - List of what was created

### ‚ùå Potential Issues

1. **Inconsistent Sizing**
   - GPT-4 might use different sizes
   - Check if within reasonable range (50-500px)

2. **Spacing Variations**
   - May use 20-50px instead of exact 30px
   - Acceptable as long as visually pleasing

3. **Missing Elements**
   - If complex request, GPT-4 might miss items
   - Retry with more explicit instructions

4. **Wrong Colors**
   - Might not always use recommended colors
   - Acceptable - can specify: "with a green button"

## Console Log Checks

### What to Look For

```
üé® [aiArrangeShapes] Starting arrangement:
üìä Total shapes to arrange: 7
‚û°Ô∏è Horizontal layout (for navbars)
‚¨áÔ∏è Vertical layout (for forms)
```

### Operation Counts

- **Login Form**: 6-7 operations
- **Contact Form**: 12-15 operations
- **Navbar**: 5-6 operations
- **Card**: 8-10 operations

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: GPT-4 Calls `getCanvasState` First
**Solution**: Already fixed in system prompt. Should not happen.

### Issue: Elements Not Aligned
**Problem**: arrangeShapes not called or wrong layout parameter
**Check**: Look for arrangeShapes in console logs
**Fix**: Try more explicit: "arrange them vertically"

### Issue: Wrong Sizes
**Problem**: GPT-4 not using recommended sizes
**Fix**: Be explicit: "with 300x40 input fields"

### Issue: Missing Labels
**Problem**: GPT-4 might skip text labels
**Fix**: Specify: "with label text for each field"

### Issue: Colors Not Applied
**Problem**: GPT-4 might use random colors
**Fix**: Specify colors: "with light gray input backgrounds and blue button"

## Advanced Testing

### Stress Tests

1. **Large Form**: "Create a registration form with 10 fields"
2. **Complex Layout**: "Create a login form with logo, two-column layout, and social login buttons"
3. **Nested Elements**: "Create a card with a nested form inside"

### Edge Cases

1. **Minimal**: "Create a form with just one button"
2. **No Arrangement**: "Create username text and password text" (should still work)
3. **Conflicting Instructions**: "Create a horizontal login form" (vertical is standard)

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics

- **Response Time**: < 15 seconds for standard forms
- **Success Rate**: > 90% for standard patterns
- **Token Usage**: < 5,000 tokens per form

### What to Measure

1. Time from command to completion
2. Number of operations
3. Visual quality (subjective)
4. Spacing consistency

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **Document Issues**: Note any patterns that don't work well
2. **Refine Prompts**: Update system prompt if specific patterns fail
3. **Add Examples**: Add successful patterns to prompt examples
4. **User Feedback**: Get real user testing on form quality
