# Alignment Tools Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented Phase 18: Alignment Tools (Tier 2) - A comprehensive alignment and distribution system that allows users to precisely arrange multiple objects with professional-grade alignment controls.

## Implementation Date
October 17, 2025

## Components Created

### 1. Alignment Utilities (`src/utils/alignmentUtils.ts`)
Core logic for all alignment and distribution operations.

**Key Functions**:
- `getSelectionBounds()`: Calculates bounding box of selected objects
  - Returns left, right, top, bottom, width, height, centerX, centerY
  - Handles circles (center-based coordinates) and rectangles/text (top-left coordinates)
  
- `alignObjects()`: Aligns objects relative to each other
  - Supports 6 alignment types: left, right, center-horizontal, top, bottom, center-vertical
  - Calculates new positions while maintaining object dimensions
  - Returns Map of object IDs to new positions
  
- `distributeObjects()`: Distributes objects with equal spacing
  - Supports 4 distribution types:
    - `horizontal-edges`: Equal gaps between object edges
    - `horizontal-centers`: Equal spacing between object centers
    - `vertical-edges`: Equal gaps between object edges
    - `vertical-centers`: Equal spacing between object centers
  - Sorts objects by position before distributing
  - Requires minimum 3 objects
  
- `alignToCanvas()`: Aligns selection to canvas boundaries
  - Supports center, left, right, top, bottom
  - Moves entire selection as a group
  - Preserves relative positioning within selection

**Type Definitions**:
```typescript
type AlignmentType = 'left' | 'center-horizontal' | 'right' | 'top' | 'center-vertical' | 'bottom';
type DistributionType = 'horizontal-edges' | 'horizontal-centers' | 'vertical-edges' | 'vertical-centers';
```

### 2. AlignmentToolbar Component (`src/components/AlignmentToolbar.tsx`)
UI component that appears when 2+ objects are selected.

**Features**:
- **Basic Alignment Section**: 6 buttons for standard alignments
  - Left, Center H, Right | Top, Center V, Bottom
  - Tooltips showing keyboard shortcuts
  
- **Distribution Section** (appears when 3+ objects selected):
  - Distribute horizontally/vertically (edges)
  - Distribute centers horizontally/vertically
  
- **Align to Canvas Section**: 5 buttons
  - Center on canvas (most prominent)
  - Align to canvas edges (smaller buttons)

**UI Design**:
- Clean, compact panel
- Icon-based buttons with tooltips
- Organized sections with labels
- Conditional rendering based on selection count
- Responsive hover states

**Custom SVG Icons**:
- Designed custom icons for each alignment operation
- Visual representation of alignment/distribution behavior
- Consistent 16x16 viewport
- Dashed lines for alignment axes

### 3. Canvas Integration (`src/components/Canvas.tsx`)
Extended Canvas component with alignment capabilities.

**New Methods**:
- `handleAlign(alignmentType)`: Applies alignment to selected objects
  - Validates selection (min 2 objects)
  - Calculates new positions
  - Updates objects in Firebase
  - Shows toast feedback
  
- `handleDistribute(distributionType)`: Distributes selected objects
  - Validates selection (min 3 objects)
  - Calculates new positions
  - Updates objects in Firebase
  - Shows toast feedback
  
- `handleAlignToCanvas(alignType)`: Aligns selection to canvas
  - Works with any number of selected objects
  - Moves entire selection as a group
  - Shows toast feedback

**CanvasRef Extensions**:
```typescript
interface CanvasRef {
  // ... existing methods
  align: (type: AlignmentType) => Promise<void>;
  distribute: (type: DistributionType) => Promise<void>;
  alignToCanvasCenter: (type: 'center' | 'left' | 'right' | 'top' | 'bottom') => Promise<void>;
}
```

**Toast Feedback**:
- Success messages for each operation
- Indicates number of objects affected
- Shows operation type in human-readable format

## App.tsx Integration

### State Management
- `selectionCount`: Tracks number of selected objects
- Updated every 100ms via useEffect polling
- Used to control AlignmentToolbar visibility

### Keyboard Shortcuts
All shortcuts use `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + [Key]`:
- **L**: Align Left
- **H**: Center Horizontally
- **R**: Align Right
- **T**: Align Top
- **M**: Center Vertically (Middle)
- **B**: Align Bottom

**Implementation**:
- Added to consolidated keyboard shortcuts handler
- Prevents default browser behavior
- Only active when not typing in input fields
- Calls canvas methods via ref

### UI Integration
- AlignmentToolbar rendered in left panel below ToolOptionsPanel
- Appears automatically when 2+ objects selected
- Seamlessly integrates with existing tool panels
- Uses space-y-4 container for consistent spacing

## User Experience Features

### Smart Selection Requirements
- **Alignment**: Requires 2+ objects
  - Toast notification if insufficient selection
  - Toolbar only appears when requirement met
  
- **Distribution**: Requires 3+ objects
  - Distribution section only shows when 3+ selected
  - Toast notification if insufficient selection
  
- **Align to Canvas**: Works with any selection
  - Single objects can be centered on canvas
  - Groups maintain relative positioning

### Visual Feedback
- Toolbar appears/disappears based on selection
- Tooltips on all buttons
- Toast notifications for all operations
- Clear iconography showing alignment direction

### Performance
- Alignment calculations are instantaneous
- Firebase updates batched with Promise.all()
- No UI blocking during operations
- Smooth toolbar transitions

## Technical Implementation Details

### Coordinate Systems
The implementation correctly handles different coordinate systems:
- **Circles**: (x, y) represents center point
- **Rectangles/Text**: (x, y) represents top-left corner
- All calculations account for these differences

### Bounding Box Calculation
```typescript
// For circles
minX = circle.x - radius
maxX = circle.x + radius

// For rectangles/text
minX = rect.x
maxX = rect.x + width
```

### Distribution Algorithm
1. Sort objects by position (horizontal or vertical)
2. Keep first and last objects in place
3. Calculate total distance between extremes
4. For edge distribution:
   - Subtract total object sizes
   - Divide remaining space equally
5. For center distribution:
   - Divide total distance by (n - 1)
   - Space centers evenly

### Firebase Integration
- Uses existing `updateObjectOptimistic` function
- Batches all updates with `Promise.all()`
- Maintains optimistic UI updates
- Handles concurrent user modifications

## Documentation Updates

### README.md
- Added "Alignment Tools" to Core Canvas Features
- Added "Distribution Tools" to Core Canvas Features
- Updated keyboard shortcuts section with alignment shortcuts

### ShortcutsPanel.tsx
- Added new "Alignment" category
- Added all 6 alignment shortcuts
- Maintained alphabetical/logical ordering
- Updated category types and arrays

## Testing Recommendations

### Basic Functionality
1. **Two Objects**:
   - Select 2 rectangles, align left/right/center
   - Select 2 circles, align top/bottom/center
   - Mixed selection (rectangle + circle)
   
2. **Three+ Objects**:
   - Distribute 3 objects horizontally
   - Distribute 5 objects vertically
   - Distribute centers vs edges
   
3. **Canvas Alignment**:
   - Center single object on canvas
   - Align selection to canvas edges
   - Align group to canvas center

### Edge Cases
1. Objects of different sizes
2. Objects with rotation applied
3. Overlapping objects
4. Objects at canvas boundaries
5. Very small or very large objects
6. Locked objects (by other users)

### Multi-User Testing
1. User A aligns objects
2. User B sees alignment immediately
3. Concurrent alignments don't conflict
4. Lock system prevents alignment conflicts

### Keyboard Shortcuts
1. All shortcuts work correctly
2. Shortcuts don't conflict with browser defaults
3. Shortcuts disabled during text editing
4. Cmd (Mac) and Ctrl (Windows/Linux) both work

## Known Limitations

1. **No Alignment Undo History** (uses standard undo system)
2. **No Alignment Preview** (operations are immediate)
3. **No Custom Spacing** (distribution uses available space)
4. **No Align to Selection** (first/last/largest) - prepared for future
5. **No Smart Guides During Drag** (already have snap guides!)

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Phase 18.3 Features (Ready to Implement)
- **Align to Selection**: Align to first/last/largest object
- **Custom Spacing**: Set specific gap values for distribution
- **Alignment History**: Track and visualize recent alignments

### Additional Ideas
- **Alignment Presets**: Save favorite alignment combinations
- **Alignment Macros**: Chain multiple alignment operations
- **Visual Guidelines**: Show alignment axes during operation
- **Alignment Handles**: Drag-to-align interface
- **Distribute with Spacing**: Specify exact pixel spacing
- **Align Along Path**: Advanced distribution options

## Architecture Notes

### Separation of Concerns
- **alignmentUtils.ts**: Pure calculation logic
